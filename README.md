# Build an Airline AI Agent Using Langflow & DataStax Astra DB

This guide walks you through how to set up a simple AI agent for an airline use case using **Langflow** and **DataStax Astra DB**.

To follow along, we recommend watching the accompanying YouTube video, which covers:

* Setting up your database
* Creating your Langflow AI agent

## Step 1: Set Up Your Database

Start by creating a **free account** on DataStax Astra DB. Use this referral link to get started: [https://bit.ly/ds-langflow](https://bit.ly/ds-langflow)

Once your account is ready, create a new database instance.

### Load Flight Ticket Data

1. In your newly created Astra DB, create a collection named `flight_tickets`.
2. Upload the data file `data/tickets.json` to this collection.

If you donâ€™t have this file or want to create your own sample, use the following prompt with your preferred LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to generate realistic flight ticket data:

```
Generate a sample JSON file with flight tickets including the following attributes:

_id  
passengerId  
passengerName  
flightNumber  
departureAirport  
arrivalAirport  
departureDateTime  
arrivalDateTime  
seatNumber  
ticketClass  
ticketPrice  
bookingDate  
bookingReference
```

### Load Invoice Data

To store invoice data, use Astraâ€™s **CQL Console** (available from your database dashboard) and run the following CQL command to create a Cassandra table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE default_keyspace.invoices (
    customer_id uuid,
    flight_id uuid,
    invoice_id uuid,
    installment_due_dates map<int, timestamp>,
    installment_plan map<int, decimal>,
    issue_date timestamp,
    payment_method text,
    status text,
    total_amount decimal,
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id, flight_id, invoice_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (flight_id ASC, invoice_id ASC);
```

After creating the table, load the invoice data by running the SQL commands found in the `data/invoice.sql` file directly in the CQL Console.

---

## Step 2: Build the Langflow Agent

You can either follow the steps in the YouTube video or fast-track the setup by importing a pre-built agent flow.

Use the JSON file provided here:
ðŸ“‚ [Airline Agent.json](airline_agent/Airline%20Agent.json)

This file can be directly imported into Langflow to recreate the AI agent workflow.

## Optional: Enable Tracing with Langsmith

If youâ€™d like to monitor or debug your Langflow agent, Langsmith provides great tools for tracing.

To enable it, set the following environment variables in your development environment:

```
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true  
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=lsv2_...
```
